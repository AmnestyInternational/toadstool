#Welcome to Toadstool

Toadstool is the next evolution of the Axle Styleguide framework.  Concepts are simple, build in the abstract and apply to the semantic. 

Toadstool is currently developed as a Sinatra app using Sass (SCSS) and Compass. 

To-do's ...
* Create a list of completed features
* Create a list of features to develop
* Get better at code documentation - readme files at every directory
* Distill /core down to a point where it makes sense to make it a gem

This is a work in progress, if you are following along at home, pull master a lot :D
