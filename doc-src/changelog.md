# Toadstool Changelog

## Aug 9, 2012
* Updated `public/javascripts/application.js` with support for creating hex values on the fly in the browser for the colors view
* Updated navigation, consolidated abstract and semantic colors view (still need to complete semantic swatches)
* BUG: Colors in the view are being pulled from Stipe, not the Toadstool styleguide.
