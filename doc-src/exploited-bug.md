#Exploited bug
It would appear that I accidentally discovered and exploited a bug that has some real impact on the architecture of Toadstool and Stipe. 

##The bug
The bug I 'discovered' using the `3.2.0.alpha.247` version of the Sass Gem is that I am able to set a default global variable and pass that into a @mixin directly. Throughout Stipe and Toadstool you will see the following:

```sass
$color: yellow !default;

@mixin foo ($color) {
	background: $color;
}

.class {
	@include foo;
}
```

Now, how did I arrive at this conclusion? Here is an example of code using a default variable and a simple class.

```scss
$color: yellow !default;

.class {
	background: $color;
}
```

What I did was take that example and insert a @mixin and low and behold it worked. Until... that is until Friday when the official Sass 3.2 gem dropped. Once I updated to 3.2 I now get this error `Mixin foo is missing argument $color`

In sending an email to the Sass Google Group, I received a response to the effect that 'this should have never (intentionally) worked.' Shit.

##The solution
It would appear that you cannot pass a global variable directly into a @mixin. The preferred method is to assign a global variable to a local variable that is being consumed by the @mixin, like so:

```scss
$default_color: yellow !default;

@mixin foo ($color: $default_color) {
	background: $color;
}

.class {
	@include foo;
}
```

##The conclusion
Well, what does this mean? This means that I need to go back throughout Toadstool and Stipe and update mixins to remove this inappropriate global variable assignment. In the mean time I will encapsulate Toadstool with a `.rvmrc` file and lock in the `3.2.0.alpha.247` Sass gem as this version is still works. 

Sorry for any inconvenience :{
