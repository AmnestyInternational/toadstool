			<p>To use grids in Toadstool, Stipe comes with some awesome Mixins for easy creation of custom grids as well as commonly used silent classes.</p>
			<p>Stipe's grid system is based on the original 960.gs solution. Whereas there are concepts like columns, gutters and nesting. For the most part when framing a UI, simply extend already pre-defned <a href="http://goo.gl/W0QlA" target="_blank">silent classes</a> like <code>@extend %grid_4</code>. These pre-formatted silent classes already come with additional support for mobile devices. </p>
			<p>If you require more customization of a given grid, use <code>@include grid($col_count)</code> whareas you are replacing <code>$col_count</code> with the number of colums you need. </p>
			<p>For nested grids, Stipe supports 'alpha' and 'omega' concepts. For added spice, if you want to remove both margins, 'alphaomega' works too. Example <code>@include grid(5, alpha)</code>.</p>
			<p>Since Stipe's grid is pure math, you can pass in floating point numbers as well. Example, if using <code>@include grid(12, alphaomega)</code> this will remove the margin on the outside of the grid, but will not be 100% across. By adding a floating point <code>@include grid(12.25, alphaomega)</code> this will address the missing space. </p>
